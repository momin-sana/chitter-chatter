# CHITTER-CHATTER APP

This is my learning phase project. It is a chatting app, a whatsapp clone app.
Chitter-Chatter provides Text chat for websites to quickly connect with each other; talk with your family friends, patients with doctors, buyers with sellers, teachers with students, gamers, community users, event attendees, and more. This allows one-on-one or group chats with share media.
In this app we can login with `Google Authentication`.
